# Confidential ML Training :weight_lifting:
Python client library for Training instance of the decentriq platform.

# What is Confidential ML Training?
By using Confidential Computing, Confidential ML Training enables you to train machine learning models based on data that nobody ever can access; not you, not us, not the infrastructure provider, nobody. This removes the risk for data breaches or data misuse.

# Demo features :sparkles:
1. Logistic Regression training with hyperparameter tuning.
2. Remote attestation service to validate security guarantees.
3. Model conversion to Scikit-learn for easy offline inference.

## Prerequisites
You need to have Python >=3.7 installed (check using `python --version`) and internet access.

## Installation

Execute the following steps in the `avato-python-client-training` folder.

1. Create a new Python environment to install into using
`python -m venv .env`
2. Activate the environment using
`source .env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies using `.env/bin/pip install .`

## Run Demo
Make sure you have the correct Python environment activated. If you just installed the module, it's already set. Otherwise you may have to run `source .env/bin/activate` again.

Set the trial user credentials via

```bash
export TEST_API_TOKEN_1="SECRET_TOKEN"
export TEST_API_TOKEN_2="SECRET_TOKEN2"
export TEST_API_TOKEN_3="SECRET_TOKEN3"
export TEST_USER_ID_2="user_2@gmail.com"
export TEST_USER_ID_3="user_3@gmail.com"
```

To run the demo start a notebook server with `.env/bin/jupyter notebook` which should open a browser window. 

In the browser window, open the `examples/training-demo-all-in-one.ipynb` notebook to perform a **full demonstration** in one go.

Alternatively, for a **simple yet fully realistic** simulation execute:

* `examples/training-demo-data-owner-1-simple.ipynb`
* `examples/training-demo-data-owner-2-simple.ipynb`
* `examples/training-demo-analyst-simple.ipynb`
