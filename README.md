# avato-training

## Prerequisites
You need to have Python >=3.7 installed (check using `python --version`) and internet access.
## Installation

Execute the following steps in the `avato-python-client-training` folder.

1. Create a new Python environment to install into using
`python -m venv .env`
2. Activate the environment using
`source .env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies using `.env/bin/pip install .`

## Run Demo
Make sure you have the correct Python environment activated. If you just installed the module, it's already set. Otherwise you may have to run `source .env/bin/activate` again.

To run the demo, install jupyter using `.env/bin/pip install jupyter` and start a notebook server with `.env/bin/jupyter notebook` which should open a browser window. In the browser window, open the examples/training-demo.ipynb notebook and run the cells!
