# Confidential ML Training :weight_lifting:
Python client library for Training instance of the decentriq platform.

# What is Confidential ML Training?
By using Confidential Computing, Confidential ML Training enables you to train machine learning models based on data that nobody ever can access; not you, not us, not the infrastructure provider, nobody. This removes the risk for data breaches or data misuse.

# Demo features :sparkles:
1. Logistic Regression training with hyperparameter tuning.
2. Remote attestation service to validate security guarantees.
3. Model conversion to Scikit-learn for easy offline inference.

## Prerequisites
You need to have Python >=3.7 installed (check using `python --version`) and internet access.

## Installation

Execute the following steps in the `avato-python-client-training` folder.

1. Create a new Python environment to install into using
`python -m venv .env`
2. Activate the environment using
`source .env/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies using `.env/bin/pip install .`
